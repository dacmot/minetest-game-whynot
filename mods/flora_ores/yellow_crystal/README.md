Yellow Crystals
===============

This mods adds crystal formations of mese. These can be found underground and mined as usual ores, but...
When you craft mese crystal seed and place it on obsidian surrounded by lava the crystal will grow.

Use crystalline bell to cut pieces of grown crystal without destroying it.

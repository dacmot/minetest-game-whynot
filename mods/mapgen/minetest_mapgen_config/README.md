Minetest Game Mapgen Configuration
==================================

This mod adds configuration tuning knobs for a variety of mapgen parameters in Minetest Game. Currently, the following are made available:

* Ore depth and scarcity
* Thickness of top filler layer (ex. dirt or sand)
* Adds a mountain-top biome layer, altitude configurable

The mod also changes the default materials in dungeons based on the biome it is found in. Additional dungeon materials available with [mtg_plus](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/mtg_plus/).

For more details, see [settingstypes.txt](settingstype.txt).

The parameters are exposed through the minetest client settings in the "All Parameters" menu.
